# virtual_lab_kvl
Developed virtual laboratory experience for demonstrating Kirchoff’s Voltage Law in an electrical circuit using django framework with python.
This project is aimed at developing a virtual lab environment where students can learn about the fundamentals of Kirchhoff’s Voltage law (KVL) and understand how it works with the help of video simulation.

The virtual lab section of the application allows students to simulate KVL on different types of circuits such as simple circuits, series circuits, parallel circuits or a combination of both simple and parallel circuit.

The user can set the number of resistors or voltage sources they want to use in the circuit. The application creates a circuit accordingly and simulates the working of KVL and gives the output. This way the student can clearly analyze and understand how the system works.

Project was developed for CMRIT Virtual Lab.
